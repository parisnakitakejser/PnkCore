# PnkCore

Welcome to PnkCore, a curated collection of sample code, templates, and tutorials built around modern infrastructure and data engineering practices.

Here you’ll find real-world examples spanning Docker, Kubernetes, Infrastructure as Code, Python, and other containerized technologies.

Created for developers, DevOps engineers, and data professionals, this repository connects directly with the educational content from my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@parisnakitakejser), hands-on resources to help you master cloud infrastructure, automation, and data pipelines.

Whether you’re building your first containerized app or designing advanced on-prem and hybrid architectures, PnkCore is your go-to foundation for understanding and implementing the backbone of modern infrastructure.
